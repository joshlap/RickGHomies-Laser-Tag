# RickGHomies-Laser-Tag

## Overview
For the theme of Hard Hack 2024, we created a hardware-based Infrared (IR) tag game you can play with friends when "the party never stops".
Each player has a gun which acts as both IR emitter and an IR receiver, and they have 3 lives. Every time the other player shoots their gun,
an audio cue plays from the speaker indicating that a life has been lost.
