# RickGHomies-Laser-Tag

## Overview
For the theme of Hard Hack 2024, we created a hardware-based Infrared (IR) tag game you can play with friends when "the party never stops".
Each player has a remote (which acts as an IR emitter), and a wearable pin (which is the IR receiver). The pin also contains a microphone module that takes in audio input,
which serves as the method of reloading ammo. Once a player gets "shot" (when their IR receiver pin gets input from another player's IR receiver remote), their pin will play
a sound from the buzzer indicating that they have been shot.
